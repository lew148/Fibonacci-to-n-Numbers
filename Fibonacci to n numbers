# The first two fibonacci numbers, as they are needed to start:
x,y = 0,1;

# Amount of iterations. 0 by default:
iteration = 0;

# While loop until n numbers have been generated:
while iteration < n:

# Prints the generated number:
#  print(x); 

# above and below can be interchaged, for different output formats

# Adds the value to the list:
  list.insert(iteration, x);
  
# Previous two numbver are added together (Fibonacci Sequence) to create new variable:
  z = x + y;
  
# x becomes the value of y and y becomes the value of z, to move dow the list:
  x = y;
  y = z;
   
# Iteration count is increased by one, becoming closer to n, where the loop will end:
  iteration = iteration + 1;
  
# Prints list when finished (comment out if using 'print(x)' format):
  if iteration == n:
